Set key results\n\nEach objective should have 3-5 corresponding key results, which are quantitative metrics that detail how you will achieve the objectives.\n\nTo answer this, ask:\n- What needs to be true in order for this objective to be achieved?\n- Are there any gaps?\n- If we achieved all of these key results, would we meet this objective?\n\n3.

Begin with pilot teams rather than a full-scale deployment across an entire organization. In the first cycle, emphasize learning about OKRs. Reserve the second cycle to explore how best to scale the program.\n\n\"Outcomes, not output\"\nWrite key results that mostly reflect outcomes (results) rather than output (amount of work delivered)\n\n\"OKRs are not everything\"\nWrite OKRs that reflect the most important areas to make measurable progress rather than attempting to reflect everything you do.
